Hello, welcome to my news and blog. I have been learning a lot about my role in
the technology world and how to better interact with those who use my work.

This is going to be a short blog to prove the concept. If I come back here and
write again it will prove that this process breaks the cycle that means that I
am correct about why I have not used the other methods.

## My role in the layers of technology

Has been curious to me for a long time. I can do a lot with a computer, and that
left me wondering, can't everyone? Office tasks and word processing have always
been a breeze. I really enjoy the collaborative process.

I use a lot of tools all day long to write various collaboration proposals.
Then there was my blog. At some point it was wordpress, and that worked okay.
Next thing you know, I decided that because I develop websites and portals I
should develop my web blog as well.

It's a simple technology from a forefront, to be able to update a website from
an admin panel. That's the last of the simple part. It's a down hill storm
from there.

A lot of my coding projects relied on too many in house tools for the project.
These things are killer. I have since learned that stuff humans write should
be in Git. It really doesn't matter if it's code. Once I place my thoughts here
we can publish them anywhere.

Markdown is an easy to parse language that looks just fine as text. To some people
maybe these things come natural. For me, its a matter of discipline and understanding
why things are.

Recently, it has become concrete to me that I work at the bottom of internet, near the
foundations of what make the web a reality. While I do develop products for the web
most of my work focuses on data centers.

At the data center leve, I have come to lear that people want a very low form of contact
when dealing with their online business. They are not going to feel comfortable behind
a client portal. There is a level of trust that has to be ascertained when managing
peoples digital data.

This matters to me because I realize that writing about coding and work should not be
preceeded by things like updating my blog software, or more webserver stuff. I came
up with a philosophy a while back not to use things I have to do when doing things I
want to do. For example, I have to fix computers a lot. So if I can find a non computer
solution to a problem. I will do that. Then I don't have to worry about going back
to work I am trying to repreieve from.

My favorite place to write is here in a text file to you. Not a crazy editor or even
word processor.

A cursor and Git yep.

Until next time.
